Introduction
============
Thi chrome plugin adds a right click context menu item into chrome for getting
an anonymous and temporary email address which forward emails to your real
email address. This lets you avoid posting your real email address to all of
those pesky websites that you are only ever going to use once but requires a
signup, and makes it possible to post contact details in a public setting
without worrying about being spammed. :)

GMail users take notice
========================
========================
Don't email your temporary address from the same address as it's pointing to
or it will get undelivered. If you really need to test it, just ask a friend to
email you.
