Introduction
============
Thi chrome plugin adds a right click context menu item into chrome for getting
an anonymous and temporary email address which forward emails to your real
email address. This lets you avoid posting your real email address to all of
those pesky websites that you are only ever going to use once but requires a
signup, and makes it possible to post contact details in a public setting
without worrying about being spammed. :)
