This plugin no longer works as the service it relied on http://tempalias.com/
has shut down. If anyone puts up another tempalias let me know.

# Introduction
This chrome plugin adds a right click context menu item for getting
a forwarding, anonymous and temporary email address. This lets you avoid posting
 your real email address to all of those pesky websites that you are only ever
going to use once. It also makes it possible to give out contact details in a
public setting without any worry. :)

### Installation
Point chrome to the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/aehiejcjjljbfgfaioacdmeiphbcojod">extension page</a>
and press install.

### Gmail users take notice
Don't email your temporary address from the same address as it's pointing to
or it will get undelivered. If you really need to test it, just ask a friend to
email you.
